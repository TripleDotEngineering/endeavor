# Introduction

This is the introduction to the document. It's filled with dummy text. Try messing around with the
`document.yaml` file to explore different rendering options.

For example, you might try setting `title_page` to `true` to create a dedicated title page.
Or consider setting `double_spaced` or `bold_titles` to `false`. You may also change font size or
title size.
